"""Steam Web API collector.

API docs: https://developer.steampowered.com/doc/webapi
Requires: STEAM_API_KEY (get one at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

Player IDs are 64-bit Steam IDs (e.g. 76561198012345678).
Find yours at: https://www.steamidfinder.com

What we collect per player:
  - Summary      → persona name, last logoff (recency signal)
  - Owned games  → playtime_forever per game (total engagement)
  - Recent games → playtime_2weeks per game (current activity)
  - Friend list  → friend count (social signal)

Reviews are collected per game (app_id), not per player.
Call get_game_reviews(app_id) separately — used by the NLP agent.
