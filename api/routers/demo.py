"""Demo Router
=============
Serves synthetic data for frontend demo mode.

All responses include "_demo": true so the frontend can display a clear
"Running on synthetic data" banner. These endpoints are completely separate
from the real /api/v1/players routes and never touch real studio data.

Endpoints:
  GET  /api/v1/demo/summary              — fleet-level stats across all demo players
  GET  /api/v1/demo/players              — list demo players (filterable by platform)
  GET  /api/v1/demo/players/{player_id}  — full analytics for one demo player
  POST /api/v1/demo/chat                 — chat agent with demo context
