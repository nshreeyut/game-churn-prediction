    <!--
      This is the only HTML file in your entire app.
      React mounts itself into <div id="root"> and takes over from there.
      All navigation, rendering, and UI is handled by JavaScript — no server
      involved after the initial page load.

      The <script> tag at the bottom points to your React entry point (src/main.jsx).
      Vite injects the correct bundled path automatically during build.
