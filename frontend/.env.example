# In DEVELOPMENT:
#   Leave VITE_API_URL empty (or unset).
#   The Vite dev proxy in vite.config.js forwards /api/* to localhost:8000.
#
# In PRODUCTION (deployed on Vercel):
#   Set VITE_API_URL to your Render backend URL.
#   Vercel will inject this at build time.
#
# IMPORTANT: All Vite env vars MUST start with VITE_
# Variables without that prefix are hidden from browser code (security).

VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.onrender.com
