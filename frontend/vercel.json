// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
// ----------------------
// Your app is a Single Page Application (SPA) — React handles all routing
// in the browser using react-router-dom.
//
// Without this file, if a user visits /chess_com/hikaru directly (or refreshes
// that URL), Vercel tries to find a file at that path on the server — it doesn't
// exist — and returns a 404.
//
// This rewrite rule tells Vercel: "For ANY path, serve index.html."
// React Router then reads the URL and renders the right component.
